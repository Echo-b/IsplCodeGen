## Introduction
This project is used to generate ispl code used for MCMAS tool verification. MCMAS is a Model Checker for Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). MCMAS takes in input a MAS specificationand a set of formulae to be verified, and it evaluates the truth value of these formulae using algorithms based on Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams.
The project is still in the early development stage and more content is still being improved.
